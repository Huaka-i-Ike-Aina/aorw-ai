# Overview

>- Understand the goals of action-oriented research.
>- Review the structure of the oultine for the research paper assignment. 
>- Create an initial outline draft using AI assisted writing. 


# Learning Objectives

- Craft a focused, researchable question.
- Plan search strategies and vet credible sources.
- Synthesize literature into a hierarchical outline with mapped evidence.
- Use Gemini in Docs responsibly for brainstorming, structuring, and revising.
- Track and reflect on AI contributions and verification steps.


# Setup and Materials
- Google account with Gemini in Google Workspace enabled (Docs: Help me write or Ask Gemini side panel).
- Google Docs, Google Scholar, library databases; Zotero or a citation manager (optional).
- Handouts: AI guardrails, source verification checklist, synthesis matrix template.
- LMS dropboxes: proposal, annotated sources, outline Doc (shared link), AI log, reflection.

# Gemini Guardrails (paste atop every prompt)

- You are an academic research coach. Do not invent sources or
  facts. If unsure, say “I’m not sure.”
- Use only sources I provide unless I ask for suggestions; label any
  suggestions as UNVERIFIED.
- When suggesting sources, give full citations with DOI/URL and a 1–2 sentence reason.
- Keep text original; preserve my citations; ask clarifying questions if needed.

<!-- # Instructor Prep -->
<!-- - Ensure Gemini features are on in Docs; demo Help me write and the side panel. -->
<!-- - Clarify course AI policy, paraphrasing/quoting expectations, and privacy. -->
<!-- - Prepare an example of a hallucinated citation and how to verify it. -->

# 1) Ethics and Tools (10 min)
- Open Gemini in Docs: Tools → Help me write or the Ask Gemini side panel.
- Show where to keep the AI log (end of the Doc or a separate section).

# 2) Topic Narrowing with Gemini (15 min)
In a new Google Doc titled “[Name] – Research Outline,” run:


Act as a research coach. For the broad topic “[topic],” propose 5 focused, feasible research questions for an undergraduate paper. For each: why it matters, likely scope, and evidence types. Ask 2 clarifying questions.

- Choose one research question (RQ); paste the final RQ at the top of the Doc.

### 3) Key Terms and Search Strings (15 min)
```text
For my research question “[paste],” list 6–10 key terms and synonyms. Draft 3 Google Scholar search strings with Boolean operators and filters (year range, peer-reviewed). State what each string is likely to retrieve.
```

- Run searches yourself in Scholar/databases (not via AI).
- Save links/DOIs in the Doc (use Cmd/Ctrl+K for smart links).

### 4) Source Vetting Drill (20 min)
For each candidate source (paste citation/abstract):

```text
Here is a citation/abstract: [paste]. Evaluate relevance, credibility, method quality, and currency. Flag red flags (predatory outlets, weak methods, missing DOI). Suggest one better, recent source if needed and label it UNVERIFIED.
```

- Independently verify all items in Scholar/library. Keep only sources you can locate.

### 5) Start Annotated Notes (15 min; finish as homework)
Create a synthesis matrix (see template below) for 5 credible, verified sources.

---

## Homework (Before Session 2)
- Complete 5 annotations in the synthesis matrix.
- Add sources in Tools → Citations (APA/MLA/Chicago). Include DOI/URL.

---

## Session 2 (Synthesize and Outline in Docs) — 75 minutes

### 6) Theme Grouping with Gemini (15 min)
Paste only your verified summaries:

```text
Using these verified source summaries [paste], group them into 2–4 themes. Note agreements, disagreements, and 2–3 gaps/tensions I can address. Do not add new sources.
```

- Add brief notes under each theme in the Doc.

### 7) Thesis and Outline Structure (30 min)
Turn on View → Show document outline. Use:
- Heading 1: Paper title
- Heading 2: Major sections
- Heading 3: Subsections

Prompt:

```text
Based on my RQ, thesis aim, and these themes [paste], propose a clear, arguable thesis and a hierarchical outline using only my verified sources.
Use:
- H2: Introduction, Background, Thematic Sections (2–3), Counterargument, Conclusion
- H3: Subpoints under each H2
Map evidence to each subpoint with placeholders like [Author Year] and 1–2 bullet points per subpoint. Do not invent sources or stats.
```

- Insert the outline; apply Heading styles.
- Link each [Author Year] tag to its DOI/URL or to the Tools → Citations entry.

### 8) Evidence Check and Refinement (15 min)
- Ensure every H3 has at least one mapped source; mark “GAP” where thin.
- Then run:

```text
Review this outline for logical flow, redundancy, and unsupported claims. Suggest concise revisions and identify any remaining GAPS. Keep my citations; no new sources.
```

- Use Suggesting mode to accept/reject edits and resolve comments.

### 9) Paraphrase Practice and Style Polish (15 min)
Pick one key passage from a source and paste it under the relevant H3.

```text
Provide two distinctly worded paraphrases that avoid close structure/wording. Include a correct in‑text citation (APA/MLA). Briefly explain your lexical and syntactic changes.
```

Then:

```text
Revise this subsection for clarity and concision in formal academic style; preserve meaning and citations; no new content.
```

## Deliverables
- Google Doc outline containing:
  - Research question and thesis at top.
  - H2/H3 hierarchical outline with bullet points and mapped citations [Author Year].
  - Linked DOIs/URLs; sources added in Tools → Citations.
  - Synthesis matrix (end of Doc or appendix).
  - AI interaction log (see below).
- Annotated bibliography (in the Doc or separate).
- Reflection (300–500 words) on Gemini’s usefulness and limits.

## AI Interaction Log (keep at end of the Doc)
For each meaningful use of Gemini:
- Paste your prompt and the response used.
- Note what you kept/changed, any errors found (e.g., hallucinated citation), and how you verified facts/links.

## Assessment Highlights
- Research question and thesis: focused, arguable, feasible.
- Source quality: peer‑reviewed, current as appropriate, verifiable; no unverified items.
- Synthesis and outline: coherent structure; themes/gaps identified; each claim mapped to evidence.
- Writing quality: clarity and academic tone in outline notes/paraphrases.
- Responsible AI use: good prompts, careful documentation, independent verification.

## Quick Gemini Prompts (copy/paste)
- Research questions:
  ```text
  Act as a research coach. For “[topic],” propose 5 focused, feasible research questions with why they matter and likely evidence. Ask 2 clarifying questions.
  ```
- Terms and searches:
  ```text
  For my RQ “[paste],” list 6–10 key terms/synonyms and craft 3 Google Scholar search strings with filters and what each should retrieve.
  ```
- Vet a source:
  ```text
  Evaluate this citation/abstract for relevance, credibility, method quality, and currency. Flag red flags. Suggest one better, recent source if needed (label UNVERIFIED).
  [paste]
  ```
- Theme synthesis:
  ```text
  Using these verified source summaries [paste], group into themes; note agreements, disagreements, and gaps. No new sources.
  ```
- Outline build:
  ```text
  Create a hierarchical outline (H2/H3) with a clear thesis and subpoints, mapping each claim to my verified sources with [Author Year] tags. No invented facts or sources.
  ```
- Flow check:
  ```text
  Review this outline for logic, redundancy, unsupported claims; suggest concise fixes; keep citations; no new sources.
  ```
- Paraphrase:
  ```text
  Provide two distinctly worded paraphrases of this passage with correct in‑text citation; explain the changes.
  ```

## Reminders and Safety
- Verify every citation via Scholar/library; never accept AI‑generated citations without checking the DOI/URL.
- Do not upload proprietary or personal data to Gemini; summarize sensitive materials yourself.
- Use Suggesting mode and comments to separate AI suggestions from your own writing.
- The outline should reflect your synthesis—Gemini is a coach and editor, not an author.
